This helmet and others like it were worn by the Necromonger Captains, officers serving in command roles within the Necromonger armies. Made of fibreglass with a padded foam lining for comfort during wear, the helmet is covered in ornate Necromonger designs with an open face. The helmet has been given a polished steel finish, with some minor distressing to give it a worn-in appearance. The helmet remains in good production-used condition with some wear to the spikes running along the crown and some minor paint flaking through use.
