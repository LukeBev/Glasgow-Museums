Barf&#39;s (John Candy) trooper uniform from Mel Brooks&#39;s 1987 sci-fi comedy, Spaceballs. In this Star Wars parody, Lone Star (Bill Pullman) and his sidekick Barf (John Candy) must protect Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) from the evil Lord Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis). This control panel can be found aboard the command center of the Spaceball One, and comes from the scene in which Dark Helmet pursues Eagle V through space at Ludicrous Speed.
