Dovchenko's (Igor Jijikine) Hero Blank-Fire Pistol from Steven Spielberg's 2008 whip-cracking adventure sequel, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Brandished by the Soviet Army Colonel, this Colt 1911 .45 has been modified to fire blanks for use in the film. Only two pistols were purchased by the film's armorer for use by Dovchenko, making this piece a rare find. This Colt .45 can be seen most prominently during the opening sequence of the film, when Indiana Jones escapes from Russian captivity in Area 51.
