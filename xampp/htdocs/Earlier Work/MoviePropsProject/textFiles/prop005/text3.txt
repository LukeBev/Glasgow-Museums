A set of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) Airline Tickets made for the production of David Fincher&#39;s gritty drama, Fight Club! These tickes were made for the scene in which the Narrator (Edward Norton) searches through drawers in an attempt to find out more about Tyler Durden. The custom boarding passes feature information including Tyler Durden&#39;s name, seating location, and his travel itinerary.
This set shows minor wear but remains in overall excellent condition.
