The &#39;electrified&#39; metal waistcoat, sleeve and glove worn by Randy (Dan Fogler) in the 2007 action comedy Balls of Fury. Former professional ping-pong phenom Randy Daytona is recruited into an undercover assignment by FBI Agent Ernie Rodriguez (George Lopez). He is assigned to enter a tournament by criminal and his father&#39;s arch fiend Feng (Christopher Walken) and hopes to bring him to justice.
This set can be seen near the end of the film when Randy and Feng have their death match Ping Pong game. Each component in this set displays signs of wear including many marks, with the front panel on the waistcoat featuring scuffs to the paint finish. However, in spite of this wear, the set remains in very good condition.
