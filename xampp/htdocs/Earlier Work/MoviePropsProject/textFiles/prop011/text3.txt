Hercules&#39; (Dwayne Johnson) club from Hercules. A club was used by the &#34;Son of Zeus&#34; throughout the film as he and his comrades fought for the freedom of Thrace. This prop weapon is made of soft urethane to ensure the safety of actors and stunt performers during the film&#39;s frenetic action sequences and features an array of detailing, including a leather lace-bound grip and four massive teeth molded into the head. The piece is finished to replicate the look of treated, worked wood and bone.
